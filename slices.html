<h1>Parameter Spaces of Kleinian Groups</h1>

<p>For an excellent overview of Kleinian groups, their limit
sets and parameter spaces, see <a href="http://klein.math.okstate.edu/kleinian/">David
Wright's page</a>. For related sites, try following <a

McMullens's Gallery</a>. </p>

<h2>The Twice Punctured Torus</h2>

<p>These pictures were created in an Internet collaboration with <a
href="http://www.maths.dur.ac.uk/~dma0jrp/">John Parker</a> and Ian Redfern.
They correspond to pairs of simple closed curves on a surface called the
&quot;twice-punctured torus&quot;, which can be thought of as the surface of a
donut that has (but does not include) two points at infinity. </p>

 <td> One quadrant of a boundary slice of the parameter space. 
    Conceptually this picture is related to the
    Mandelbrot set, although it corresponds to an entirely different parameter
    space of dynamics.  The
     space of all possible limit sets of twice-punctured tori is 4-dimensional.
     This space has a 3-dimensional boundary, and this picture depicts a
     projection of a 2-dimensional slice of that boundary. Each &quot;ray&quot;
     corresponds to a homotopy class of simple loops (equivalently, a simple
     closed geodesic) on the surface. As the ray approaches the boundary, the
     length of the loop goes to zero and the surface &quot;pinches&quot;. At
     the boundary, the surface has been pinched into a pair of triply punctured
     spheres, and the corresponding limit set is a circle packing.</td>

<h2>The Earle Slice</h2>

 <td> A short Internet collaboration with Caroline Series and
Yohei Komori resulted in this crude and partial
rendering of one quadrant of the Earle slice, which describes a family of
quasifuchsian groups. The bottom left of the graphic is at the origin of the
complex plane. The <a href="slices/earle_algorithm.gif">description </a>of the
algorithm used makes reference to the terminology of 
<a href="http://www.warwick.ac.uk/~masbb/Papers/43-earle.pdf">the paper by Series and Komori.</a>
