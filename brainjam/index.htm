<h1>Brain Jam</h1>

<p>
Brain Jam is a Windows solitaire game/card puzzle.
The deck is initially dealt face up,
so there is no luck involved once play begins.
All  hands are winnable. Featured in <i>Games</i> magazine.
Based on "Baker's Game" described by Martin Gardner 
in Scientific American in 1968.

If you want to play the orginal 16-bit Windows version, download the file
<a href="brainj92.zip" onclick="urchinTracker('/downloads/brainj92');"> brainj92.zip</a>
 and install it using WinZip.
If you don't have WinZip, decompress the file into a
temporary directory.  From there, run SETUP.EXE to install.  This version will not run on a 64 bit computer.

My wife would like Brain Jam thrown into the River Thames
as it is very compulsive playing.

I think your Brain Jam game is terrific.

There really ought to be a law against it ... what an
insidious piece of software - I am surprised it hasn't
brought about the total collapse of Western Civilization!
... super fun and *extremely* addictive.

My wife has rapidly become an addict of your game.

I've finally found a game that my father will play, so
I thought I'd better register a copy for him.
