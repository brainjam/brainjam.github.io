        Billiards on a hyperbolic symmetry.  There are only 3 balls, repeated across the tiling shown by the dotted lines. Thread. (1/n)

        Here's a full view of the Poincar√© model and the controls.  I'll give the URL for the live version later in thread.  (2/n)

        On the left side is the action on a single tile, along with some stats.
        The transforms of each ball in the immediate neighborhood are also shown. Not only do balls collide with each other within the tile, they can even collide with their own transforms.  (3/n)

        In what universe do entities collide with their transforms?  Probably none, but I implemented this to scratch an itch.  Confession: when balls self collide, kinetic energy is hacked to preserve total energy because the high school physics equations for elastic collisions don't preserve energy in this case.  (4/n)

        You can remove balls.  Here we reduce our universe to a single lonely particle.  Which exhibits the aforementioned problematic self collisions.  But often what looks like self-repulsion or self-orbiting is just copies flying past each other near or at tessellation vertices (5/n)

        You can can add balls.  Producing a hyperbolic gas, I guess. (6/n)

        You can also change ball size.  Adding balls produces different phases of hyperbolic matter. (6/n)
